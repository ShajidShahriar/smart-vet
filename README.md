## About The Project

Smart-Vet is an intelligent career tool designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and applicant tracking systems (ATS). By leveraging Google's **Gemini AI**, it analyzes resumes against specific job descriptions to provide actionable feedback, match scoring, and optimization suggestions.

The goal is simple : help candidates understand exactly why they might be getting rejected and how to fix it in seconds.

## Key Features

* **AI-Driven Analysis** : Utilizes the Gemini API to deeply understand context, skills, and nuances in both the CV and Job Description.
* **Match Scoring** : Provides a quantified "Match Percentage" to gauge application strength instantly.
* **Gap Identification** : Highlights missing keywords and skills that the employer is specifically looking for.
* **Actionable Feedback** : Offers concrete, tailored advice on how to rephrase bullet points and summaries for better impact.
* **Secure & Fast** : Built with Next.js for server-side rendering performance and secure API handling.
